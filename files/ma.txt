The cloning of animals, which has been occurring for several years, raises the possibility of cloning humans as well. While cloning for spare body parts offers clear benefits, I believe it also brings about a number of ethical concerns.

As a result of advancements in medical science and better diets, people are now living longer. However, this has led to the problem of organ failure as individuals age. Human cloning could offer a solution, as cloned organs could be used to replace those of sick individuals. Currently, there is often a shortage of organ donors which cloning humans could address by providing a readily available supply.

Nevertheless, this development is viewed as troubling by many, and for good reason. Firstly, religious arguments stand against it. Creating and killing human beings in order to use their organs can be considered murder, which goes against religious beliefs. Moreover, it raises questions about the rights of these cloned individuals, as they should be considered humans with equal rights. Additionally, if human cloning becomes possible, where will it end? Would it be acceptable to clone deceased relatives or family members?

In conclusion, I do not support the procedure of cloning humans due to the ethical issues and dilemmas it presents. While cloning animals has been a positive advancement, it should not be extended to human cloning.
